Consider AlphaPrompt as a comprehensive RAG platform which effectively manages over 50,000 documents per customer. Key in this RAG journey, post-data connection, is the efficient extraction of information from each document. This includes not only the raw text but also the valuable information embedded in the documentâ€™s layout, images, tables, figures, etc., and organizing this information in a way that enhances the RAG process.
To maximize efficiency in terms of quality of results, cost and time, consider advanced extraction techniques that can interpret and structure diverse forms of data. Employing OCR for text, specialized algorithms for table and figure analysis, and AI to understand and categorize document structure can be pivotal. The aim is to create a comprehensive data model that captures the essence of each document, facilitating its utility in the RAG process. What are potential solutions to achieve this aim?
Incorporating the document's storage hierarchy into the RAG workflow can add significant value, offering context and aiding in the categorization of information. How and to which extent should this be considered in the RAG process? 
The strategy for document chunckinng might be dynamic, considering the diversity in document length and type. A dynamic chunking approach, tailored to the specific characteristics of each document, will likely yield the best results. This might mean variable chunk sizes based on document content density, type, or specific structural markers within the document. Again, in terms of quality of results, cost and time, what is the best approach for chuncking the retrieved text?
